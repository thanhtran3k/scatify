Welcome, this is Catto. I built this basic website with helps of NodeJS, ExpressJS framework, EJS for the front-end and noSQL database Firebase.

===================MY NOTES===========================

1. Download my project to your computer.

2. Open Git Bash.

3. Install libraries: "npm install".

4. To run the project: "npm start".

5. The project runs on PORT 3000.

6. The project is linking to my database on "https://firebase.google.com/". If you want to change the link to my database to yours, just change the  variable "config" below to yours.

var config = {
    //My configs are provided by firebase.
  };
  
  Read the docs of firebase to learn more.
  
7. I used my persional account as administrator account. To use all the functions available change or remove the "authData.email == 'thanh.tran3k@gmail.com'" in the front-end pages if you see.

8. I regret not using camelCase in this project. Forgive me if it makes feel bad. I will change when i have free time.

Finally, if you have any questions, contact me.
