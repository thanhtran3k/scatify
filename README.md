Welcome, this is Catto. I built this website with helps of NodeJS, ExpressJS framework, EJS for the front-end and noSQL database Firebase.

===================MY NOTES===========================

1. Download my project to your computer.
2. Open Git Bash.
3. Install libraries: "npm install".
4. To run the project: "npm start".
5. The project runs on port 3000.
6. The project is linking to my database on "https://firebase.google.com/". If you want to change my database to yours, just change the  variable "config" below to yours.

var config = {
    //My config provided by firebase.
  };
  
  Read the docs of firebase to learn more.
  
7. I used my persional account as administrator account. To use all the functions available change or remove the "authData.email == 'thanh.tran3k@gmail.com'" in the front-end pages if you see.

Finally, if you have any questions, contact me.
