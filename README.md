Welcome, this is Catto. I built this website with helps of NodeJS, ExpressJS framework, EJS for the front-end and noSQL database Firebase.

====NOTE====

1. Download my project to your computer.
2. Open Git Bash.
3. Install libraries: "npm install".
4. To run the project: "npm start".
5. The project runs on port 3000.
6. The project is linking to my database on "https://firebase.google.com/". If you want to change my database to yours, just change the config below to yours.

var config = {
    //My config provided by firebase.
  };
  
  Read the docs of firebase to learn more.
